# Image Captioning - Generate short descriptions for images

## Overview
This repository contains the code for an image captioning project implemented using the COCO (Common Objects in Context) dataset and Transformers. The project aims to generate descriptive captions for images using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques.

## Features
- Utilizes the COCO dataset, a large-scale object detection, segmentation, and captioning dataset.
- Implements Transformers, a deep learning architecture known for its effectiveness in sequence-to-sequence tasks.
- Generates descriptive captions for images using the trained model.
- Provides pre-trained models for image captioning with options for fine-tuning.

## Requirements
- Python 3.10
- pytorch_pretrained_bert
- Transformers
- pycocotools
- Other dependencies (listed in requirements.txt)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-captioning.git
   cd image-captioning
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Download the COCO dataset and extract the necessary files.

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook image_captioning.ipynb
   ```
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess the COCO dataset, train the image captioning model, evaluate the trained model, and generate captions for new images.
   
## Results
- Example captions generated by the trained model:
  ```
  Image: example.jpg
  Caption: A group of people standing on a beach with surfboards.
  ```
