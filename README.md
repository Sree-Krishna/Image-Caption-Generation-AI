# Image Captioning with COCO Dataset and Transformers

## Overview
This repository contains the code for an image captioning project implemented using the COCO (Common Objects in Context) dataset and Transformers. The project aims to generate descriptive captions for images using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques.

## Features
- Utilizes the COCO dataset, a large-scale object detection, segmentation, and captioning dataset.
- Implements Transformers, a deep learning architecture known for its effectiveness in sequence-to-sequence tasks.
- Generates descriptive captions for images using the trained model.
- Provides pre-trained models for image captioning with options for fine-tuning.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Transformers
- COCO API
- Other dependencies (listed in requirements.txt)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-captioning.git
   cd image-captioning
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Download the COCO dataset and extract the necessary files.

## Usage
1. Preprocess the COCO dataset:
   ```
   python preprocess.py
   ```
2. Train the image captioning model:
   ```
   python train.py
   ```
3. Evaluate the trained model:
   ```
   python evaluate.py
   ```
4. Generate captions for new images:
   ```
   python generate_caption.py --image_path <path_to_image>
   ```

## Results
- Example captions generated by the trained model:
  ```
  Image: example.jpg
  Caption: A group of people standing on a beach with surfboards.
  ```
